                    <p class="answer">
                        Entry requirements vary according to many factors like country, course, level of education and

                    <p class="answer">
                        Apart from a general requirement of completion of a lower level of study with at the very least
                        45%
                        marks, there is also a requirement to have shown proficiency in an English language test. Some
                        courses and universities also require you to have appeared for and have university mandated
                        minimum
                        scores in exams like GRE, GMAT or even SAT.

                    <h5 class="question">How much will it cost to study abroad?
                        <br>
                        What is the cost of studying abroad for Indian students?
                    </h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        The costs associated with studying at a university or school abroad vary greatly. It depends on
                        the level of education, the destination of your studies, your lifestyle preferences and even
                        your current and future academic performances.
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Starting from Germany where the tuition fees are very low or even free, there are countries and
                        universities where the tuition fees can go very high. Scholarships are available for meritorious
                        students and this can significantly reduce the cost of tuition fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        One of the ways to manage the cost of education is to work part-time. Although many countries do
                        allow students to work part-time, some countries restrict it completely. It is better to be
                        aware of this and plan accordingly.

                <li class="qa-wrapper three">
                    <h5 class="question">When should I start planning my study abroad procedure?</h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        We recommend you start as early as possible. There are many factors to consider and at times
                        mandatory exams to prepare and perform. Selecting the right study destination, course,
                        university, documentation, visa process all takes time. Keeping a buffer of 3-4 months depending
                        on the country, we advise students to start about 9 months before the planned intake. However,
                        visiting CGE earlier and understand the timeline of your application can help you plan for the
                        correct intake.

                <li class="qa-wrapper four">
                    <h5 class="question">How long does the application process take?</h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        The entire application process once you have completed giving tests and collected documents can
                        still take some time. This is because the university after application takes around 4-6 weeks to
                        decide on your application. This is then followed by loan application and approval which can
                        take another month depending on cases. Finally, the visa is also a time-consuming activity with
                        medical tests, financial documentation, biometrics and at times a visa interview.

                    <h5 class="question">Should I go abroad for undergraduate studies? Is it advisable to study abroad
                        for a bachelor’s degree?</h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        There are multiple reasons why studying abroad for undergraduate programs will make for a good
                        decision. There are a variety of programs, the quality of education is higher, international
                        exposure opens up a world of possibilities and imaginations, flexibility of programs means you
                        can choose your minors as you study. In some universities, you will also see that completing an
                        undergraduate program at the university can help you take admission to the graduate or master’s
                        program.

                    <h5 class="question">What if I can’t afford to study overseas?</h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        The good news is that you do not need to fund the entire cost of studying abroad on your own.
                        There are various education loans available from different institutions that can help you for
                        the same.
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Also, various scholarships and bursaries are available for international students to help them
                        fund their studies. The amount and availability differ by the level of education and
                        institution. Since scholarships are competitive, you will have to demonstrate exceptional
                        academic achievements to earn them. There are also some government scholarship programs to help
                        international students manage and fund their tuition fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Another way to manage your overseas education cost is to work part-time in most countries. This
                        makes sure that you do not rely on your parents on guardians back home to fund your monthly
                        expenses including accommodation and food. We even have stories of students who have worked
                        part-time to fund not only their living costs but also a big part of their tuition fees.

                        P.S.: Canada also provides an option for courses where the students can work full time for a
                        term and study for another term called Co-op programs.

                <li class="qa-wrapper seven">
                    <h5 class="question">Can I work and study at the same time?</h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Many countries allow international students to work for a certain number of hours during
                        studies. This is an excellent option for students to work and earn money to manage living
                        expenses. Some countries don’t allow any part-time work at all. The Co-op programs in Canada
                        come with a study and work permit allowing students to work full time helping them to gain
                        valuable industrial experience and a chance to prove themselves
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Many universities have a dedicated job center on campus for students that advertises job
                        opportunities and internships to help students develop various skills. The university careers
                        service is also a useful source of information.

                    <h5 class="question">Will my overseas qualification be recognized in India? What is the value of an
                        abroad degree in India? Can I come back to India after MS in USA?</h5>
                    <p class="answer">
                        Ideally, we recommend that students work in a foreign country after completion of studies. This
                        helps them gain international exposure and work experience which could be a positive factor for
                        their work application back in India. Having said that, most of the degrees abroad are valid and
                        considered in case you would like to pursue future education back in India. For professional
                        degrees like medicine, law, and others the validity of the degree may be determined by further
                        studies or examination.

                    <p class="answer">
                        Educational qualifications and a good academic track record usually will help you further your
                        professional goals. The world works in the same way it does in India for a demand and supply
                        scenario. Selection of the right course, completing studies with good grades and most
                        importantly networking with the right people will hold you in good stead for job applications.

                    <p class="answer">
                        While you can apply to study directly to an institution, you may choose to use the expertise of

                        the process of choosing the right university or college and enrolling thereafter. Using an
                        accredited and trusted consultant can help reduce the stress of choosing an institution in
                        another country, applying and preparing to leave.
